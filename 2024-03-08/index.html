        Women's are such powerfull creation of ALMIGHTY ALLAH. Although they face so problems in there life but they
        never give up. Just like men's women's are also part of society that play's an important role in the society .
        Before the Islam the women's were considered as lower and non-usefull part in society. But After Holy Prophet
        (SAW) , women's got there respect and rights . Every one should have respect and manners for women.
